## Project Overview
For my third project, I have decided to make an app for those that are big on music! I also decided to add in a Spotify API to challenge myself a little bit more since the router was taken off the requirements (I also couldn't figure out how to add in a router no matter how hard I tried and looked for solutions).
## Details/Functionality
I have created an application where you can save your liked/favorite albums. In this application, you have a simple navbar, which doesn't do anything (I couldn't figure out how to do a router). You then have your main section where you are able to type in a album and add it into the list of albums (in my head, this was sort of like adding a song to a playlist). With these albums in this list you can delete them from the list with a simple click of a button. You can also reorder the list with a simple click of buttons. Also there is a function where you can "Love" a song and add it into a "Favorite Albums" section, or if not, there is always the "All" and the "Liked Albums" sections as well. Last but not least, there is a search bar at the bottom of the application where you can type in a artist of your choice, and the application will pull all of the released albums of that artist to make any searches easier, just in case you can't think of an album name.
## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React.js
## Future Improvements
* I would like to add a way to be able to add the albums listed from the spotify API into the list.
* I would like to add in a way to actually be able to play music from the album that you click on.
* I would like to clean up the look of the page and make it more aesthetically pleasing to the eye.
* I would like to add in a router, as I did not figure out how to do that in this project.
* I would like to take it one step further, and also show songs, and not only albums.
